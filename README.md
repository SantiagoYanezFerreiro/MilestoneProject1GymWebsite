## Responsiveness
**Navigation Menu:** It becomes a Hamburger Menu on small devices.

**General Info:** Used order to alter the order of the elements in small devices. I thought it would look better to place first a text block, then the two images and finally the last text block. Each text block/img occupies the entire screen size (col-12) on small devices.  Also reduced the font-size on medium and small devices.

**Footer:** Each section occupies the entire screen width on small devices (col-12) and the elements get stacked one below the other.

**Classes:** On medium devices two classes occupy the entire screen width and on small devices each class takes the entire width (col-12). Reduced font-size on small tables and phones since it looked too big on these devices.

**Memberships and Services:** Each of them occupies half of the screen width on medium devices, so two get display alongside, and the entire width on small devices. Furthermore, added a big of margin for membership-boxes on small devices.

**FAQ’s:** Just reduced the screen size and the font-size for small tablets and phones so that it looks better.

**Contact Info and Form sections:** They occupy the entire screen width on small devices and get placed one below the other on them.

**Heading Tags:** Reduced Font-Sizes for Small Phones and modified margins. The font-size was too big for these screens. They occupy the entire width (col-12) on all devices and are centered.


## Links and images
All links function and all images are in the Gitpod repository.

## Bugs & Problems
•	Had to use JavaScript function for the FAQs section, so that only one question’s answer could be open. It looked quite bad when there was the possibility to open several at the same time.

•	The background-image of the form didn’t look so well initially (too big and not centered). Solved this problem by setting a maximum background size of 750px and background-position: top.

•	The membership-section stretched too much on big screens so needed to set a max-width of 1300px for very wide monitors.

•   Also struggled a bit with Markdown formatting since I haven't done so many README Files and had to make a lot of commits to correct small mistakes.
